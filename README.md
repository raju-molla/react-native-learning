To Fix the react navigation/drawer: Reanimated 2 failed to create a worklet, maybe you forgot to add Reanimated's babel plugin?
solve: 
  ***Run yarn add react-native-reanimated@next react-native-gesture-handler
  ****I have added import 'react-native-gesture-handler' to App.tsx file at the top of the file before importing any packages
  ***You should update the babel.config.js file and add react-native-reanimated/plugin to plugins
    module.exports = {
      presets: ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"],
      plugins: [
        "react-native-reanimated/plugin",
      ],
    };
  ***The last thing you should do is run your project by removing the cache yarn start --reset-cache
